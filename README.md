# BÃ©isbol Quest

This project is a trivia game for a school contest.

Created by Santiago Danda.

## -Info about the project-

It uses ncurses library for the graphics, so the game is only intended to run in unix-like terminals.

Not all the sprites are mine. I used some of the Patjork's website tools for generating the fonts, and some sprites of the ASCII archive page.
